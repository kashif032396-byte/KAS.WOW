Part 2: Developer Guide
This guide is intended for developers who wish to understand, maintain, or extend the WOW website.

1. Overview
The entire site is a single HTML file (index.html) that uses:

HTML5 for structure.

CSS3 (custom styles + Bootstrap 5.3.2) for layout and animations.

jQuery 3.7.1 for DOM manipulation and event handling.

jsPDF 2.5.1 for PDF generation.

Bootstrap Icons and Google Fonts (Cinzel, Inter) for typography and icons.

All external resources are loaded via CDN, so an internet connection is required.

2. File Structure
The file is logically organised:

<head> – meta tags, title, external CSS, favicon, jsPDF script.

<style> – all custom CSS (variables, layout, animations, responsive overrides).

<body> – contains the visible elements and the final <script> block.

3. Key HTML Components
3.1 Navbar (<nav class="navbar">)
Fixed top with a dark translucent background.

Brand: full text “WONDER OF WORLD” on large screens, “WOW” on very small screens (via .full-brand/.short-brand).

Navigation links use data-section attributes to trigger section switching.

The #sevenWondersLink scrolls to the first wonder after showing the home section.

3.2 Advertise Card (#advertiseCard)
A fixed‑position element that toggles class expanded on click (except when a link inside is clicked).

Contains a collapsed icon and expanded content with booking links.

3.3 Booking Modal (#bookingModal)
Standard Bootstrap modal with a form.

#bookNowBtn performs basic validation and shows an alert.

3.4 Image Modal (#imageModal)
Used in the gallery to display enlarged images.

The #modalImage src is set when a gallery thumbnail is clicked.

3.5 Search Box (#searchBox)
Hidden by default; class visible added when on home or gallery sections.

Input #search handles filtering (see JavaScript).

3.6 Home Section (#home-section)
Contains a scrollable #mainScroll div with scroll-snap-type: y mandatory.

Each wonder is a <section class="wonder-section"> with:

A carousel of images (Bootstrap carousel with fade effect).

An overlay <div> for gradient.

.wonder-content with title, preview, and PDF button.

The data-full attribute holds the complete historical text.

3.7 Other Sections
Gallery, Feedback, Contact, About, Sitemap, Queries – each is a section with id="...-section" and class page-section.

They are hidden by default and shown via the active-section class.

3.8 Detail Overlay (#detailOverlay)
A fixed overlay with a two‑column card (carousel + text).

Dynamically populated when a .wonder-content is clicked.

4. JavaScript Core Functions
All code is wrapped in $(document).ready().

4.1 Section Switching
javascript
function showSection(sectionId) {
    $('.page-section').removeClass('active-section');
    $(`#${sectionId}-section`).addClass('active-section');
    // show/hide search box
    if (sectionId === 'home' || sectionId === 'gallery') {
        $('#searchBox').addClass('visible');
        // ... reset search
    } else {
        $('#searchBox').removeClass('visible');
    }
    if (sectionId === 'home') setTimeout(initHomeSidebar, 50);
}
Called by any element with data-section attribute, as well as special links (#homeNavLink, #sevenWondersLink).

4.2 Sidebar Navigation Icons
initHomeSidebar() iterates over all .wonder-section elements, extracts the first carousel image, and creates .nav-icon thumbnails inside #sidebarNav. Each icon has a data-target pointing to the corresponding wonder’s ID.

4.3 Scroll Spy
The scroll event on #mainScroll checks the position of each wonder and:

Highlights the matching .nav-icon with class active.

Adds class active to the visible .wonder-section (triggers the content fade‑in).

4.4 Detail Overlay Population
When .wonder-content is clicked (excluding the PDF button):

Title and full text (data-full) are set in #detailTitle and #detailFullText.

All images from the wonder’s carousel are cloned into #detailCarouselInner.

#detailOverlay gets class active to become visible.

4.5 Search Functionality
The #search keyup handler checks which section is active:

Gallery section: filters .wonder-gallery blocks by comparing the h3 text with the query. If none visible, appends a “No matching wonders” message.

Home section: searches data-name of each wonder and scrolls to the first match. If no match, adds temporary search-error class.

4.6 Gallery Builder
buildGallery() loops through a hardcoded array of wonder IDs and names, collects all image src from each wonder’s carousel, and generates the gallery grid inside #galleryContainer. This function runs once on page load.

4.7 Star Rating
Clicking a star in #starRating toggles classes (bi-star ↔ bi-star-fill) for all stars up to the clicked index.

4.8 Feedback Form
On submit, prevents default, shows an alert, and saves the data to localStorage as a JSON string.

4.9 Geolocation
#geoBtn uses the navigator.geolocation API to display latitude/longitude or an error message.

4.10 PDF Generation
The download-pdf button (inside each wonder) uses jsPDF:

Creates a new PDF document.

Adds the wonder name (bold) and the full description (wrapped to fit).

Saves the file with a sanitised name.

5. CSS Highlights
5.1 Custom Properties
css
:root {
    --accent: #c6a84a;
    --dark: #0a0a0a;
    --ease: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1);
    --navbar-height: 70px;
}
Change these to alter the colour scheme and navbar height.

5.2 Scroll Snapping
css
.scroll-container {
    height: 100vh;
    overflow-y: scroll;
    scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
}
.wonder-section {
    height: 100vh;
    scroll-snap-align: start;
}
5.3 Carousel Zoom Effect
css
.carousel-item img {
    transform: scale(1);
    transition: transform 10s linear;
}
.carousel-item.active img {
    transform: scale(1.15);
}
5.4 Responsive Breakpoints
@media (max-width: 991.98px) – tablet/mobile: navbar collapses, side icons become a bottom row, detail modal stacks, etc.

@media (max-width: 375px) – extra small: brand switches to “WOW”, advert card width reduced.

@media (max-width: 480px) and (min-width: 376px) – fine‑tuning for medium phones.

6. How to Add a New Wonder
Duplicate an existing .wonder-section block (e.g., copy the #tajmahal section).

Change the id to a unique value (e.g., #new-wonder).

Update the data-name attribute with the wonder’s name.

Replace the carousel images with your own <img> tags.

Edit the .wonder-title, .wonder-history-preview, and the data-full text.

Update the PDF button’s data-name and data-desc attributes.

In the buildGallery() function, add the new wonder’s name and ID to the wonderNames and wonderIds arrays.

The side navigation will be generated automatically from the first image.

7. Customisation Tips
Colours: modify --accent in :root.

Fonts: change the Google Fonts link and the font-family rules.

Images: replace image paths. Ensure the folder structure matches or use absolute URLs.

Text content: edit any HTML text directly.

PDF styling: adjust the jsPDF parameters (font, size, margins) inside the download-pdf click handler.

8. Dependencies
All loaded via CDN:

Bootstrap CSS & JS

jQuery

Bootstrap Icons

Google Fonts

jsPDF

No local build process is required; simply edit the HTML file and refresh.

9. Browser Support
The site uses modern CSS features (backdrop-filter, scroll-snap-type, CSS variables) and JavaScript (ES6). It works in all recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Internet Explorer is not supported.
