WOW · Wonders of the World – Complete Documentation
This document contains two separate guides:

User Guide – for visitors who want to explore the website.

Developer Guide – for programmers who want to understand, modify, or extend the code.

Both guides are based on the provided index.html file.

Part 1: User Guide
Welcome to Wonders of the World (WOW) – an immersive website that lets you discover the New Seven Wonders through stunning imagery, detailed history, and interactive features.

1. Getting Started
Open the website in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

An internet connection is required to load images and external resources (Bootstrap, fonts, icons).

The page starts at the Home section with a dramatic full‑screen introduction.

2. Navigating the Site
The navigation bar at the top (or the hamburger menu on mobile) contains links to all main sections:

Home – returns to the scrollable wonder showcase.

Seven Wonders – scrolls directly to the first wonder (Great Wall).

Gallery – grid view of all wonder images.

Feedback – leave a rating and comment.

Contact – see address, phone, and use geolocation.

About – brief information about the project.

Site Map – quick links to sections.

Queries – ask a question (placeholder form).

Click any link to switch sections. On mobile, the menu automatically closes after selection.

3. Home Section – The Wonders
The home page is a vertical scroll with snap‑scrolling – each wonder fills the entire screen.

3.1 How to Browse
Scroll down/up to move between wonders.

Right side (desktop) or bottom row (mobile) shows circular thumbnails – click any to jump directly to that wonder.

The active wonder’s thumbnail is highlighted with a gold border and glow.

3.2 Each Wonder Slide
Every wonder slide contains:

A background carousel of multiple images that slowly zoom in.

A gold‑accented text panel with the wonder’s name and a short preview.

A “Click to expand details” hint – click anywhere on the text panel (except the PDF button) to open a detailed overlay.

3.3 Detailed Overlay
When you click a wonder’s text panel, a full‑screen overlay appears with:

A carousel of all images for that wonder (left side on desktop, top on mobile).

The complete historical text with dates and facts (right side).

A close button (×) at the top right – click it or the background to return.

3.4 PDF Download
Each wonder has a “Download PDF” button. Click it to generate a PDF file containing the wonder’s name and full historical description. The file is saved automatically.

4. Search Box
The search input appears only on the Home and Gallery sections (centered below the navbar).

On Home: type a wonder name (e.g., “Petra”) – the page scrolls to that wonder. If no match is found, the search box briefly turns red.

On Gallery: type a wonder name to filter the gallery – only matching wonder groups remain visible. If nothing matches, a “No matching wonders found” message appears.

5. Gallery Section
The gallery displays all images from every wonder, grouped by wonder name. Each thumbnail is clickable – it opens a full‑size version in a lightbox modal (click the × or outside to close).

6. Feedback Section
Leave your rating and comments:

Click the stars to set a rating (1–5).

Fill in your name, email, and message.

Submit – a confirmation alert appears, and the data is saved in your browser’s local storage (demo purpose).

7. Contact & Geolocation
The contact card provides:

Email, phone, and address.

“Find my location” button – if you allow location access, your current latitude and longitude are displayed below.

The adjacent “Quick message” form is a placeholder.

8. Booking and Advertise Card
At the bottom‑left corner, you’ll see a small gold‑bordered circle with a bus icon.

Click it – it expands into a horizontal bar with links: “Bus to Petra” and “Flight to Machu Picchu”, plus a discount code.

Click any link – the booking modal opens. Fill in the destination, travel mode, name, email, and date, then click “Book Now” for a demo confirmation.

Click the card again (not on a link) to collapse it back to a circle.

9. Other Sections
About – short mission statement.

Site Map – textual links to all sections (same as navbar).

Queries – a simple form to ask a question (placeholder).

10. Mobile Experience
The site is fully responsive:

On tablets and phones, the side navigation moves to the bottom.

The detail overlay stacks images above text.

The navbar collapses into a hamburger menu.

Very small screens (e.g., iPhone SE) show the brand as “WOW” instead of the full name.
